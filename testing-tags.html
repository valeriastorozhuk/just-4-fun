        <p>Perfume is a <b>powerful tool to express our personality</b>, <small>build our self-image and engage with  others</small>. Fragrances, in fact, accompany us in everyday life 
            and tell something about us,<br> raising memories and feelings.</p>

        <p><mark>history of perfume is definitely not recent. <s>The origin of perfume is commonly attributed to the ancient Egyptians</s>. They utilized scents to celebrate prayers 
            and religious ceremony by burning essential oils, resin, and perfumed unguents.</mark><!--Only yellow highlited text in HTML?/--></p>

                From Etruscans, for example, seems to derive the habit of burning essences in special containers or censers, to spread the perfume during playful moments, dances <wbr>and funeral rites. It is especially in the Roman domus that the spread of fragrances begins to accompany daily convivial situations and banquets. But even outside the private context, access to Roman baths allowed anyone to wash and apply perfumed oils and unguents.

        <p><strong>This practice had several functions</strong>. First, the oils and unguents burned H<sub>2</sub>O were necessary MC<sup>2</sup> to ensure divinities’ protection and benevolence. Besides, scents were also used to convey<br> messages and prayers to the dead, to purify the body and to conduct embalming ceremonies.</p>

        <p>Over time, scents were not only confined to the sacred aspects, <del>but they were also introduced in daily hygiene. Already at the time of the ancient Egypt there was an intense 
            trade of spices, aromas and resins that were abundant in Egypt but also imported from 
            distant lands such as the Middle East, Arabia and the Indians lands.</del> From these trades were imported fine woods, scented resins, myrrh and incense that made up some of the main 
            ingredients 
            of the scents of the time.</p>

        <p>The sacred function of the scent is not lost in time though, and it goes on together with the secular one through the centuries. The Book of Exodus gives a precious testimony<br> 
            of the use of perfume as sacred offerings in the <em>Jewish</em> religion. <pre>The same adoration of the Magi narrated in the Bible demonstrates the importance of the gesture of offering sacred essences such as incense and myrrh.</pre></p>
        <p>In addition, the perfume was used in religious ceremony to purify the body and as a real cosmetic. 
            <q>Unguents, water and perfumed oils were obtained with slow process of maceration</q> 
            and extraction of essences from aromatic plants, woods and resins.</p>
        <p>During the period of the ancient Greeks, <ins>the perfume leaves its religious rituals and begins to accompany everyday life of common people</ins>. While continuing to accompany the sacred<br> rituals and key moments like births, weddings and funeral ceremonies, perfume now also enters the profane sphere. It's linked to the myth of beauty and body care, and is precisely in this sense that it begins to play a fundamental role in everyday life. Expeditions to the East through the Spice trade will then allow the discovery of new exotic and precious materials, facilitating an intense perfume trade all over the world then known.</p>
